<p>Use this rule to control that the YAML documents do contain a required key (parameter <var>required-key-name</var>).
    Parameters can be defined as a regular expression.</p>

<p>Because not all documents are certainly expected to contain the indicated key, an initial "filter" key/value (the parameters
    <var>parent-key-name</var> and <var>parent-key-value</var>) is used to identify the documents that must be checked.
    Use the parameter <var>parent-key-name-root</var> to tell where this so-called parent key must be located in the
    document. The location of the key can also be defined with two ancestor regular expressions.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>parent-key-name</dt>
    <dd>Regular expression that matches prerequisite key name. Leave empty for no parent checking.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>parent-key-value</dt>
    <dd>Regular expression that matches the value for the prerequisite key name</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>parent-key-name-root</dt>
    <dd>Tells if the filter parent key must be located at the root level of the document (<code>yes</code>code>),
        if it must not be located at the root level of the document (<code>not</code>) or if it can be located anywhere
        in the document (<code>anywhere</code>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>required-key-name</dt>
    <dd>Regular expression that matches the required key name</dd>
</dl>

<dt>included-ancestors</dt>
<dd>Regular expression that matches against an ancestor string made of joining the parent chain of the matching key.
    The parents are separated by a colon (<code>:</code>) and always start with an implicit <code>&lt;root&gt;</code> parent.
    So, the ancestor string for a connectionTimeout key could be: <code>&lt;root&gt;:spring:datasource:hikari</code>.
    If the includedAncestors regex matches the ancestor string of the key, the key is checked.
    The start and end line markers <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are implicit, just like the key regex.
    Leave empty for no included ancestor matching.</dd>
<dt>excluded-ancestors</dt>
<dd>Regular expression that matches against the ancestor string of the matching key, just like above.
    However, if this regex matches, the key is *not* checked.
    The start and end line markers <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are implicit, just like the key regex.
    Leave empty for no excluded ancestor matching.</dd>

    <li>Current limitation: yaml list notation is not supported by ancestor matching.</li>
