<p>Use this rule to control that the YAML documents do not contain a key. Key names can be defined as a regular expression.
    The location of the key can be defined with two ancestor regular expressions.

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>key-name</dt>
    <dd>Regular expression that matches forbidden key names</dd>
    <dt>included-ancestors</dt>
    <dd>Regular expression that matches against an ancestor string made of joining the parent chain of the matching key.
        The parents are separated by a colon (<code>:</code>) and always start with an implicit <code>&lt;root&gt;</code> parent.
        So, the ancestor string for a connectionTimeout key could be: <code>&lt;root&gt;:spring:datasource:hikari</code>.
        If the includedAncestors regex matches the ancestor string of the key, the key is checked.
        The start and end line markers <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are implicit, just like the key regex.
        Leave empty for no included ancestor matching.</dd>
    <dt>excluded-ancestors</dt>
    <dd>Regular expression that matches against the ancestor string of the matching key, just like above.
        However, if this regex matches, the key is *not* checked.
        The start and end line markers <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are implicit, just like the key regex.
        Leave empty for no excluded ancestor matching.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>With <code>key-name = [tT]e.*t</code>
    the following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    Test1: value
    tesT: {key1: 4, key2: 8}
</pre>
<p>the following code snippets would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    test: value
</pre>
<pre>
    tesT: {Test: 4, key2: 8}
</pre>
